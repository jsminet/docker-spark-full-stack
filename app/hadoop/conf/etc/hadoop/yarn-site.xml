  <property>
    <description>Amount of physical memory, in MB, that can be allocated for containers. 
      If set to -1 and yarn.nodemanager.resource.detect-hardware-capabilities is true, 
      it is automatically calculated(in case of Windows and Linux). 
      In other cases, the default is 8192MB. </description>
    <name>yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb</name>
    <value>4096</value>
  </property>

  <property>
    <description>	The maximum allocation for every container request at the RM in MBs. 
      Memory requests higher than this will throw an InvalidResourceRequestException.</description>
    <name>yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb</name>
    <value>2048</value>
  </property>

  <property>
    <description>The minimum allocation for every container request at the RM in MBs. 
      Memory requests lower than this will be set to the value of this property. 
      Additionally, a node manager that is configured to have less memory 
      than this value will be shut down by the resource manager.</description>
    <name>yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb</name>
    <value>512</value>
  </property>

  <property>
    <description>	Number of vcores that can be allocated for containers. 
      This is used by the RM scheduler when allocating resources for containers. 
      This is not used to limit the number of CPUs used by YARN containers. 
      If it is set to -1 and yarn.nodemanager.resource.detect-hardware-capabilities is true, 
      it is automatically determined from the hardware in case of Windows and Linux. 
      In other cases, number of vcores is 8 by default.</description>
